## Description

- My motivation for this project stemed mainly from starting it to be honest. At first it was about just trying to stay ahead of what was to come as a coding bootcamp student but then turned into something else completely. As I went along with the lessons it started becoming very exciting to continue and learn. Now im more excited than ever to continue learning about the full stack process. 
- I built this project because it was intimidating, at first I didnt think much of it until I progressed and things began getting a little scary. As I learned to understand the material little by little I began to understand the process and it only motivated me more to finish and see things through. Building and analyzing the code using HTML to format, CSS to style, GIT to navigate, and JavaScript to interact became exciting to learn on after. 
- The code I wrote attributes to being more than a workpiece for the coding bootcamp but also serves as a refference and study-guide to help me out in the future when need be.
- This project has allowed me to learn a lot about the fullstack process and has given me a much better understanding on how to utalize code languages to host my very own webpage. I have also learned a lot about myself because of the way I was able to want to seek and grasp the understanding of something that seemed so overwhelming at first.
